# Frontend Masters "simple" challenge with React

Hi, welcome to my repository, I'm tryna clear my mind to grab some inspiration in learning advanced topics.
For that, I'm learning react, It's a must-learn framework for front end purposes. 

I'm not using states for now, I'm getting through the basics with a simple layout making.

This is what I have to do:

To clarify my dudes, front end it's not one of my streghts, of course I know how to use flex and grid. 
As you can notice, I have some bugs in the lower/last column group, rows aren't correctly centered,
it can be due to image and text overflow.

There's also a white big space when site is in mobile mode and I dont know how to remove that $h1t:

It's annoying to try correcting this crap but at least challenge's almost complete. And most important I'm
dominating more the react basics.
